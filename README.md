# Overview
[Locale](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.twofortyfouram.locale) allows developers to create plug-in conditions and settings.  The android-display-condition-plugin-for-locale implements an example plug-in condition.  This project is the final layer of the [Locale Developer Platform documentation](https://www.twofortyfouram.com/developer).

Although there are multiple ways to approach building a plug-in condition, we recommend forking this project as the starting point.
